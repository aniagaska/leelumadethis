# Aly is a great writer 
A website comissioned by an author's beautiful wife, who lovingly went through reviews of her books and took screenshots of the good ones. This way, she is spared the terrors of the internet. 

## Leelu made this
The domain is [leelumadethis.lol](http://leelumadethis.lol) because Leelu is a cat and the lol was available. Leelu once danced on the keyboard that Aly was using to write a manuscript and nearly lost the entire thing. She also set her author photo as the desktop background! The manuscript was recovered and Leelu's crime was thwarted. 

### Make this for your loved one
If you know someone who makes things that gets reviews online, please feel free to follow Emily's example and screenshot the good ones.
