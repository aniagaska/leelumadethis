# Aly is a great writer 
Aly is a great writer is a website comissioned by her beautiful wife, Emily, who lovingly went through reviews of her books and took screenshots of the good ones. This way, Aly gets the encouragement she needs without having to witness the terrors of the internet. 

## Leelu made this
The domain is [leelumadethis.lol](http://leelumadethis.lol) because Leelu is a cat and the lol was available. Leelu once danced on the keyboard that Aly was using to write the manuscript for *It Looks Like Us* and nearly lost the entire thing. She also set Aly's author photo as the desktop background! The manuscript was recovered and Leelu was thwarted again. 

### Make this for your own loved one
If you know someone who makes things that gets reviews online, please feel free to follow Emily's example and screenshot the good ones.
